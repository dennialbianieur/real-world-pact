# Charkha Development Guide

Welcome to the Charkha development guide! This guide describes how to translate the [Charkha white paper](../Charkha-Protocol-Whitepaper.pdf) into a set of smart contracts. Along the way we'll explore related DeFi topics such as price oracles, bridges, and implementing fungible tokens.

In short, the white paper specifies the protocol, the smart contracts implement the protocol, and this development guide describes how we moved from the specification to the implementation.
