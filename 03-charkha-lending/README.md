# Charkha Lending Project (WIP)

The Charkha lending protocol is a full-stack decentralized finance app built on Kadena's Chainweb blockchain. DeFi has been one of the standout uses of smart contracts, and Charkha is inspired by the popular [Compound](https://compound.finance) lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. However, Charkha is stripped to the bare essentials so that it is usable as a learning project.

Charkha combines a TypeScript + React frontend using [kadena.js](https://github.com/kadena-community/kadena.js) and a smart contract lending protocol written in Pact. It demonstrates a number of advanced concepts for dapp development on Chainweb, including:

- Developing sophisticated, real-world smart contracts to implement a "white paper" spec
- Interact with off-chain data (real-world asset prices, for example)
- Implementing unit tests, integration tests, and formal verification for our contracts

Charkha is still under development.
