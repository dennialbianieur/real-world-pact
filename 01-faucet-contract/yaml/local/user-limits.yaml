# This request asks the Goliath faucet contract for details on the per-request
# and per-account limits set for the user account.
#
# You can execute this request:
# faucet-request --local user-account-details
#
# This request will only succeed if the user account exists (ie. has received
# funds). To create this account, deploy the faucet smart contract and then
# request funds for the user account:
#
#   faucet-deploy
#   faucet-request --send request-funds --signers goliath-faucet
#
# Then you can run this request to see account limits.
