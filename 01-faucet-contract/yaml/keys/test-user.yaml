# This file contains a keypair usable for creating a test user account on devnet
# that can exercise the Goliath faucet API. We can use this account to request
# funds and ensure that they were received properly. On testnet, this would be
# an actual user account that wishes to use the faucet.
#
# These keys were generated via the Pact v4.3.1 CLI:
#     pact --genkey > api/keys/test-user.yaml
