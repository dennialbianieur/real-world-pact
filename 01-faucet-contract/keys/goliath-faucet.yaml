# This file contains the keypair used to control the Goliath faucet contract. A
# keypair consists of a public key, which is shared with others (for example, it
# is listed in the keyset that guards the goliath-faucet account), as well as a
# secret key, which should never be shared or committed. We've only committed
# this file because this is a demo project.
#
# These keys were generated via the Pact v4.3.1 CLI:
#     pact --genkey > api/keys/goliath-faucet.yaml
